'''
Takes in a calibration image with a few randomly placed PSFs OR Seidel coefficents, fits Seidel coefficients (if none provided) to the PSFS, and 
gives back the PSF stack needed for LRI from those Seidel coefficients.

Arguments:
    calib_image - (N x N) numpy array with randomly scattered PSFs

    num_radii - positive integer which determines how many radii are used for blurring/deblurring determines speed and memory size (recommended set to N).

    seidel_coeffs - (6 x 1) numpy array. The primary seidel coefficients with a defocus parameter appended before

    sys_params -  parameters of the system takes the form of a dictionary: {'samples': N, 'L': sidelength length of sensor, 'lamb': wavelength,
                      'pupil_radius': radius of system pupil, 'z': distance from pupil to sensor}. All lengths are in millimeters

    opt_params - optimization parameters used for the Seidel fitting procedure. Takes the form of a dictionary: {'iters': number of iterations, 'lr': learning rate, 'reg': l2 regularization}

    verbose - Boolean (True or False). Determines if the code will output descriptive print statements.

    device - torch.device. Determines the device all quantities will be placed on. Will be cuda or cpu depending on if a GPU is being used.

Returns: 
    psf_stack_roft - (num_radii x N x N) torch tensor. Can be viewed as a num_radii stack of N x N images where each image is the rotationaly fourier transform of a PSF. The PSFs are ordered 
    by increasing distance of their generating point source from the center.

    seidel_coeffs - (6 x 1) numpy array storing the 5 primary coefficients preceded by a defocus parameter. These coefficients were used to generate psf_stack_roft

'''
Takes in an object/scene and radial stack of PSF rotationally fourier transforms, and returns a blurred image from the system with the PSFs in the stack. 
Computes the LRI forward model to get the blurred image.

Arguments:
    obj - (N x N) numpy array representing an object that the user would like to blur. 

    psf_stack_roft - (num_radii x N x N) torch tensor. Can be viewed as a num_radii stack of N x N images where each image is the rotationaly fourier transform of a PSF. The PSFs are ordered 
    by increasing distance of their generating point source from the center. Can be gotten from calibrate.

    verbose - Boolean (True or False). Determines if the code will output descriptive print statements.

    artifact_correction - real number in (0,1). Mitigates image artifacts caused by discretizing the polar transformation. Costs a single
    run of blur function. Works by subtracting the output of a constant object. Its value determines the strength of correction.

    device - torch.device. Determines the device all quantities will be placed on. Will be cuda or cpu depending on if a GPU is being used.

Returns
    blurred_image - (N x N) numpy array that is a blurred version of the object according to the PSFs from psf_stack_roft
